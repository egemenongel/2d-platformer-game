# Unity

--- My Unity codes will be here ---

2D Platformer Game GOALS:

- Menu - UI
- Hidden Room
- Powerups (Star in Mario, weapons from Mega Man)
- Maybe vehicles
- Bosses
- Smarter Enemies
- Traps
- More animations
- More background elements
- Story

Planning to create a Portal alike 3D or 2D game. It can be interesting to create mechanics about bullets.
